# Games-and-Platforms-research
Research of the most popular platforms and games in different regions   
The research made for the on-line store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. Historical data on game sales are available from open sources. We identified patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow us to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns for the next year.
